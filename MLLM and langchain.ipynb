Was this on Twitter?\\n[     Josh O.:] And blog posts\\n--- 11:50 AM ---\\n[     Josh O.:] I think Doug is mostly referring to this: http://words.cdmwebs.com/let-s-start-with-why\\n[Doug A. tweeted:] Let\\'s Start with Why: http://t.co/nLU5KJysTw -- @cdmwebs, http://twitter.com/cdmwebs/status/359006444173000704\\n[     Doug A.:] For sure: ^^^^\\n[     Alan A.:] thx, I was pretty unplugged this weekend\\n[    Geoff C.:] Chris\\' post I thought hit it right on the head. (I was finally able to catch up last night on twitter / blog posts.) \\n[     Doug A.:] It\\'s kinda hard to have an extended conversation 140 characters at a time, but I\\'m really interested in what motivates you to participate\\n--- 11:55 AM ---\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] bbq\\'s are great places to have conversations\\n[     Josh O.:] indeed, they were!\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] we should have more of them\\n[    Carin M.:] +1\\n--- 12:05 PM ---\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] i\\'ll do another one as long as burgers and sausages are good enough\\n[     Josh O.:] +1\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] who knows, maybe cdmwobs and dougalcorn will even show up\\n[      Ben S.:] Doug Alcorn:  I\\'m still trying to figure out best way to express thoughts.  Was tricky to follow Twitter conversation and I\\'m still a bit confused as to the main goals.  Is it to build a better tech community?  Increase exposure of tech community to non-tech community?  And, at the risk of offending Miss Manners, I need to figure out how to make it on Scott\\'s invite list. :)\\n[     Josh O.:] woah\\n[     Josh O.:] for shame, BEAR\\n--- 12:10 PM ---\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] you\\'re on it\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] i should set up an email list or something\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] what\\'s good software for that these days?\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] cincytechbbq or something - i don\\'t want to limit bbqs to being just at my house\\n[      Ben S.:] Ha, thanks!\\n[     Josh O.:] an email list?  Mailchimp is my goto usually\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] word\\n[      Ben S.:] http://i.minus.com/ix8kSpghnwQMl.gif\\n[Josh O. played a sound:] trololo\\n[      Ben S.:] My favorite troll face ->\\n[      Ben S.:] http://www.whoateallthepies.tv/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/dempsey.gif\\n[Josh O. tweeted:] If Prince William and Kate Middleton have a daughter and DON\\'T call her Princess Leia, they\\'re wasting everybody\\'s time. #RoyalBaby -- @DeathStarPR, http://twitter.com/DeathStarPR/status/359323118617104385\\n[    Geoff C.:] So, I haven\\'t been in Cincinnati probably as long as most of you (moved here from DC / worked a lot in SF / grew up just outside NYC). But I see the potential for a tech community that could be very unique from those in certain aspects, yet still maintain a lot of the core stuff Nate talked about at QC Merge. \\n--- 12:15 PM ---\\n[     Alan A.:] I second Ben on everything, especially on the BBQ! I\\'ve never actually thought about why I do it, just love doing it & being  part of something so transformative\\n[      Ben S.:] I also think it\\'s a matter of figuring out what resonates with people regarding being active in the community.  For NYTM, it seems like their format (structured demos of working software) seems to work.  That *may* not be the thing that works here.  Obviously the social aspect seems to work here (web/tech drinkup), but demo stuff still seems to be silo-ed by specific technology.  Maybe something more community service related could be used to build community (whether it\\'s building tech with open data, or going out to build a Habitat for Humanity home)\\n[    Geoff C.:] And I completely agree, BBQs (especially with home brewed beer) are the best place for these kind of conversations! (I\\'m pretty sure I saw that we have that skill set in our tech community too.)\\n[     Josh O.:] I think the goal was to add demos on to the Web/tech drinkup\\n[    Geoff C.:] I think that would be a huge plus for the web/tech drinkup.\\n[     Josh O.:] Chris Moore still won\\'t give a straight answer if that is still his current thinking :)\\n--- 12:20 PM ---\\n[     Josh O.:] And the service related ideas are good imo too\\n[     Josh O.:] Ben Stafford: there was some light hackathon planning around a civic hackathon for cincy, this weekend\\n[Doug A. has left the room]\\n[     Josh O.:] https://github.com/OpenHack-Cincinnati/hackathons\\n[      Ben S.:] Josh: Yeah, saw that (why I mentioned it), although it got a bit lost in Twitter conversation - there were a couple kind of parallel conversations going on.\\n[      Ben S.:] I wasn\\'t sure if points of conversation had moved away from OpenHack-Cincinnati on purpose or accidentally.\\n[     Josh O.:] Well, Chris Moore challenged people to blog more, so I did: http://thoughts.unicoder.io/building-communities-are-hard\\n--- 12:25 PM ---\\n[     Josh O.:] I think his why post was a general response to that and other tweets\\n[     Josh O.:] I think a demo environment could go a long way\\n[      Ben S.:] Gotcha.\\n[     Josh O.:] in helping educate and unite some of the tech clusters\\n[      Ben S.:] May just need to identify the \"influencers\" in other tech groups to get cross-technology demos to actually happen\\n[     Alan A.:] I think your right Josh. The demo environment needs to be less of \"how it works\" and more of \"why we are doing it\", to an extent\\n[     Alan A.:] easy to get lost in details of frameworks your not familiar with\\n[     Josh O.:] yeah, showing a how takes more than 5-10 minutes :)\\n[     Alan A.:] What are the other big tech communities around here? .Net & java obviously because of the mega-corps...\\n--- 12:30 PM ---\\n[     Josh O.:] .net, java, js, ruby, cocoa are the ones I know of\\n[     Josh O.:] that are around frameworks\\n[      Ben S.:] I *think* the PHP UG is pretty healthy, but not positive\\n[     Josh O.:] oh yeah, and php\\n[      Ben S.:] Gerard is a good connector with PHP\\n[     Josh O.:] We have stolen him into Meteor.js land now :)\\n[      Ben S.:] Meteornapped\\n[      Ben S.:] Luckily, I don\\'t think PHPUG made him turn in his badge.\\n[     Alan A.:] meteroid\\n--- 12:50 PM ---\\n[Joel T. has left the room]\\n[Carin M. has left the room]\\n--- 01:00 PM ---\\n[Carin M. has entered the room]\\n--- 01:05 PM ---\\n[    Chris M.:] It\\'s not about the events, that\\'s my point.\\n[    Chris M.:] We have those. I\\'m reluctant to start more until we talk about the why.\\n[    Chris M.:] That\\'s what will bring it all together\\n[    Chris M.:] Events are just a part of it.\\n[Doug A. has entered the room]\\n[    Chris M.:] Demos, hackathons, etc are reasons to get together and do things that work toward our shared vision\\n[    Chris M.:] Does that make sense?\\n[     Alan A.:] communication problem, what if we start with a hashtag? Might be the easiest way to get things rolling...\\n[    Chris M.:] I have no preference for the tool.\\n[    Chris M.:] Whatever allows us to have open dialogue is the most important thing.\\n[      Ben S.:] I like the idea of not diluting/fragmenting with more events, but how do we grow community without events?  Or are you thinking that we use existing ones to unify?\\n[    Chris M.:] Also, why is the Cincy maker group private?\\n--- 01:10 PM ---\\n[     Alan A.:] just thinking about simplicity for now.. mvp\\n--- 01:10 PM ---\\n[    Chris M.:] @Ben Stafford: YES!\\n[    Chris M.:] bring them together. one REALLY BIG, REALLY loud voice\\n[    Chris M.:] instead of 100 smaller, quieter ones\\n[    Chris M.:] point the Enquirer at the firehose of amazing innovation activity\\n[     Alan A.:] we need a unified communication channel. Segmented events are good (ruby, php, etc.) as are meta-web (drink up). Biggest issue is the channel I htink\\n[      Ben S.:] Right, it does seem like the obvious place that has momentum (at least in our fragment) is the drinkup.\\n[      Ben S.:] But how do we get drinkup momentum to translate into growing and giving back to Cincinnati...\\n[Chris N. has entered the room]\\n[    Chris M.:] By defining a purpose we all understand and can get behind\\n--- 01:15 PM ---\\n[    Chris M.:] When we all have the same goal, it\\'s easy to convince others to join us\\n[    Chris M.:] What is YOUR reason for joining user groups, teaching, training, volunteering?\\n[    Chris M.:] Are we all on the same page?

From the twitter conversation, it seems like there are lots of goals (better startup environment, better funding environment) that people may have.  IMO, (and take it for what it\\'s worth), the primary goal should be more altruistic - using our talents to make our larger community (Cincy) better  - whether that\\'s improving STEM education, community service work, building open data APIs...  It\\'s fine that those other goals exist, but I don\\'t think they unify a tech community into growing.\\n[     Doug A.:] THE BEAR: I\\'m so bummed I missed the bearbbq\\n[    Chris M.:] YES!\\n[    Chris M.:] Ben is on it.\\n[    Chris M.:] If you could write that in one sentence, what would it be?\\n[    Chris M.:] It\\'s more than \"funding\" and \"startups\" and \"VC\"\\n[      Ben S.:] Hmm, let me try taking out every third word :)\\n[    Chris M.:] we have the talent and tools to *really* make a difference\\n--- 01:25 PM ---\\n[    Chris M.:] that\\'s what I want to do\\n[      Ben S.:] I think the less altruistic goals should NEVER be obvious - should only be a happy side effect.\\n[    Chris M.:] the brandery and the startup community is welcome to come along\\n[Joel T. has entered the room]\\n[Bill B. has entered the room]\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] i don\\'t care at all about funding or VC\\n[     Josh O.:] neither do I\\n[     Josh O.:] I spend my nights working on shit that won\\'t ever earn me direct dollars\\n[ðŸ‘Š THE BEAR ðŸ‘Š.:] and for me startups are just a byproduct of people doing cool shit, i don\\'t care much about them either\\n[      Ben S.:] Exactly, it fragments the potential audience\\n[      Ben S.:] I love the enthusiam and energy of founders and people in that scene, but that scene is not for everyone.\\n[      Ben S.:] Chris Moore:  Hard to to one sentence because I feel that it oversimplifies so many aspects.

Also, it sounds like we\\'re not on same page about \"channels\".
